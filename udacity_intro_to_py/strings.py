# Quiz: Fix the Quote
# The line of code in the following quiz will cause 
# a SyntaxError, thanks to the misuse of quotation marks. 
# First run it with Test Run to view the error message. 
# Then resolve the problem so that the quote (from Henry Ford) 
# is correctly assigned to the variable ford_quote.

# TODO: Fix this string!
# ford_quote = 'Whether you think you can, or you think you can't--you're right.'

ford_quote = 'Whether you think you can, or you think you can\'t--you\'re right.'



# Quiz: Write a Server Log Message
# In this programming quiz, you’re going to use what you’ve 
# learned about strings to write a logging message for a server.
# You’ll be provided with example data for a user, the time of 
# their visit and the site they accessed. You should use the 
# variables provided and the techniques you’ve learned to print 
# a log message like this one (with the username, url, and 
# timestamp replaced with values from the appropriate variables):
# Yogesh accessed the site http://petshop.com/pets/reptiles/pythons 
# at 16:20.
# Use the Test Run button to see your results as you work on coding 
# this piece by piece.

username = "Kinari"
timestamp = "04:50"
url = "http://petshop.com/pets/mammals/cats"

# TODO: print a log message using the variables above.
# The message should have the same format as this one:
# "Yogesh accessed the site http://petshop.com/pets/reptiles/pythons at 16:20."

message = username + " accessed the site " + url + " at " + timestamp + "."
print(message)




# Quiz: len()
# Use string concatenation and the len() function to find the 
# length of a certain movie star's actual full name. Store 
# that length in the name_length variable. Don't forget that 
# there are spaces in between the different parts of a name!

given_name = "William"
middle_names = "Bradley"
family_name = "Pitt"

name_length = len(given_name + " " + middle_names + " " + family_name)#todo: calculate how long this name is

# Now we check to make sure that the name fits within the driving license character limit
# Nothing you need to do here
driving_license_character_limit = 28
print(name_length <= driving_license_character_limit)
