# Quiz: len, max, min, and Lists
# There is a Python environment for you to run test code 
# at the bottom of this page related to any of the quizzes 
# on this page!

# What would the output of the following code be? 
# (Treat the comma in the multiple choice answers as newlines.)

# a = [1, 5, 8]
# b = [2, 6, 9, 10]
# c = [100, 200]

# print(max([len(a), len(b), len(c)])) ===> 4
# print(min([len(a), len(b), len(c)])) ===> 2



# Quiz: sorted, join, and Lists
# What would the output of the following code be? 
# (Treat the comma in the multiple choice answers as newlines.)

# names = ["Carol", "Albert", "Ben", "Donna"]
# print(" & ".join(sorted(names))) ===> Albert & Ben & Carol & Donna



# Quiz: append and Lists

# What would the output of the following code be? 
# (Treat the commas in the multiple choice answers as newlines.)

# names = ["Carol", "Albert", "Ben", "Donna"]
# names.append("Eugenia")
# print(sorted(names)) ===> ["Albert", "Ben", "Carol", "Donna", "Eugenia"]
