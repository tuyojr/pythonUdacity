# Quiz: Fruit Basket - Task 1
# You would like to count the number of fruits in your basket. 
# In order to do this, you have the following dictionary and 
# list of fruits. Use the dictionary and list to count the total 
# number of fruits, but you do not want to count the other items 
# in your basket.

result = 0
basket_items = {'apples': 4, 'oranges': 19, 'kites': 3, 'sandwiches': 8}
fruits = ['apples', 'oranges', 'pears', 'peaches', 'grapes', 'bananas']

#Iterate through the dictionary
for key, value in basket_items.items():
#if the key is in the list of fruits, add the value (number of fruits) to result
    if key in fruits:
        result += value

print(result)




# Quiz: Fruit Basket - Task 2
# If your solution is robust, you should be able to use it with any dictionary of 
# items to count the number of fruits in the basket. Try the loop for each of the 
# dictionaries below to make sure it always works.

#Example 1

result = 0
basket_items = {'pears': 5, 'grapes': 19, 'kites': 3, 'sandwiches': 8, 'bananas': 4}
fruits = ['apples', 'oranges', 'pears', 'peaches', 'grapes', 'bananas']

# Your previous solution here
for key, value in basket_items.items():
    if key in fruits:
        result += value
print(result)

#Example 2

result = 0
basket_items = {'peaches': 5, 'lettuce': 2, 'kites': 3, 'sandwiches': 8, 'pears': 4}
fruits = ['apples', 'oranges', 'pears', 'peaches', 'grapes', 'bananas']

# Your previous solution here
for key, value in basket_items.items():
    if key in fruits:
        result += value
print(result)


#Example 3

result = 0
basket_items = {'lettuce': 2, 'kites': 3, 'sandwiches': 8, 'pears': 4, 'bears': 10}
fruits = ['apples', 'oranges', 'pears', 'peaches', 'grapes', 'bananas']

# Your previous solution here
for key, value in basket_items.items():
    if key in fruits:
        result += value
print(result)
