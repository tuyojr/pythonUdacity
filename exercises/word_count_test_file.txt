This semester, asides from learning new things with regards to our specific crafts, we’d be looking to polish ourselves in every way we can. This means you’d need to focus on being the best version of yourself in all aspects including your technical & non-technical skills. The past few weeks has seen us get into a number of partnerships with organisations sourcing talents and only the best of us would gain access to this opportunity when it’s time for internships. That being said, we’d commence sharing the details of your second semester performance tracking in emails and your circles from this evening. You’ll also be getting onboarded to new courses on the LMS for the semester.
