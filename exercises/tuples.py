# Exercise 1: Revise a previous program as follows: Read and parse 
# the "From" lines and pull out the addresses from the line. Count 
# the number of messages from each person using a dictionary.

# After all the data has been read, print the person with the most 
# commits by creating a list of (count, email) tuples from the 
# dictionary. Then sort the list in reverse order and print out the 
# person who has the most commits.
