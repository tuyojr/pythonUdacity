# Importing and accessing from modules
# In this quiz, you'll be using different methods to import 
# and use the random.randint() function from the random module. 
# Your task is to match the import statement with the way you 
# would then call the function itself.

# Match the import statement with the way that random.randint() is called.

import random # ===> random.randint(0, 10)

from random import randint # ===> randint(0, 10)

import random as rd # ===> rd.randint(0, 10)

from random import randint as rint # ===> rint(0, 10)

from random import * # ===> Don't use this import statement
