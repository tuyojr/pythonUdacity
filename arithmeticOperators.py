# Average Electricity Bill

# It's time to try a calculation in Python!
# My electricity bills for the last three months have been 
# $23, $32 and $64. What is the average monthly electricity 
# bill over the three month period? Write an expression to 
# calculate the mean, and use print() to view the result.
# Write an expression that calculates the average of 23, 32 and 64
# Place the expression in this print statement

print((23 + 32 + 64)/3)



# In this quiz you're going to do some calculations for a tiler. 
# Two parts of a floor need tiling. One part is 9 tiles wide by 
# 7 tiles long, the other is 5 tiles wide by 7 tiles long. 
# Tiles come in packages of 6.
# How many tiles are needed?
# You buy 17 packages of tiles containing 6 tiles each. How many 
# tiles will be left over?

# Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles are needed.
noOfTiles = (9*7)+(5*7)
print(noOfTiles)

# Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles will be left over.
print((6*17) - noOfTiles)


# Which of these lines of Python code are well formatted? 
# How would you improve the readability of the codes that 
# don't use good formatting? (Choose all that apply)

print((17 - 6)%(5 + 2))

print(4/2 - 7*7)
