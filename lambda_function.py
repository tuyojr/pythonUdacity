# Quiz: Lambda with Map
# map() is a higher-order built-in function that takes a 
# function and iterable as inputs, and returns an iterator 
# that applies the function to each element of the iterable. 
# The code below uses map() to find the mean of each list in 
# numbers to create the list averages. Give it a test run to 
# see what happens.

# Rewrite this code to be more concise by replacing the mean 
# function with a lambda expression defined within the call to map().
