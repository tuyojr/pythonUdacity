# Imagine an air traffic control program that tracks 
# three variables, altitude, speed, and propulsion 
# which for a particular airplane have the values 
# specified below.

altitude = 10000
speed = 250
propulsion = "Propeller"

# For each of the following boolean expressions, work 
# out whether it evaluates to True or False and match 
# the correct value.

altitude < 1000 and speed > 100     # ===> False
(propulsion == "Jet" or propulsion == "Turboprop") and speed < 300 and altitude > 20000     # ===> False
not (speed > 400 and propulsion == "Propeller")     # ===> True
(altitude > 500 and speed > 100) or not propulsion == "Propeller"     # ===> True




# Quiz: Using Truth Values of Objects
# The code below is the solution to the Which Prize quiz 
# you've seen previously. You're going to rewrite this 
# based on what you've learned about truth values.

# points = 174

# if points <= 50:
#     result = "Congratulations! You won a wooden rabbit!"
# elif points <= 150:
#     result = "Oh dear, no prize this time."
# elif points <= 180:
#     result = "Congratulations! You won a wafer-thin mint!"
# else:
#     result = "Congratulations! You won a penguin!"

# print(result)

# You will use a new variable prize to store a prize name if one 
# was won, and then use the truth value of this variable to 
# compose the result message. This will involve two if statements.

# 1st conditional statement: update prize to the correct prize name 
# based on points.
# 2nd conditional statement: set result to the correct phrase based 
# on whether prize is evaluated as True or False.

# If prize is None, result should be set to "Oh dear, no prize this 
# time."
# If prize contains a prize name, result should be set to 
# "Congratulations! You won a {}!".format(prize). This will avoid 
# having the multiple result assignments for different prizes.
# At the beginning of your code, set prize to None, as the default value.

points = 174  # use this as input for your submission

# establish the default prize value to None
prize = ""

# use the points value to assign prizes to the correct prize names
if points <= 50:
    prize = "wooden rabbit"
elif points <= 150:
    prize == ""
elif points <= 180:
    prize = "wafer-thin mint"
else:
    prize = "penguin"

# use the truth value of prize to assign result to the correct prize

if prize:
    result = "Congratulations! You won a {}!".format(prize)
else:
    result = "Oh dear, no prize this time."


print(result)
